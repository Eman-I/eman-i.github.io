                    <p> I am Eman Ibrahim, an international student currently enrolled in the
                        <strong>computer programming</strong> program at Algonquin College, 
                         currently at my second level. Prior to pursuing programming, I 
                         worked as a Mathematics teacher after completing my 
                        <strong>bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Education</strong>. 
                        Recognizing programming as a natural extension of the 
                        <strong>problem-solving</strong> skills inherent in Mathematics, 
                        I discovered an interest in programming courses during my first degree. 
                        This interest led me to pursue a <strong>diploma in computer programming
                        </strong>. Through hands-on projects in my current studies, 
                        I have further developed my <strong>passion</strong>  for 
                        <strong>programming</strong> and <strong>databases</strong>.
